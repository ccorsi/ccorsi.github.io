I just finished reading a book by Matt Haig called, "The Life Impossible". It is
a story of fiction that I really enjoyed. The thing about it is that it has allowed
me to think about life. We as humans tend to forget that we are living in an
incredible world. We forget to really look around us and truly see the world. We've
become obsessed with social media. Yes, we see many influencers living life but they
are the ones living life. Most of us are watching them do that and not really participating
ourselves in this life. We should try to put our devices down and just go explore the
world around us.

This world around us has more to show us than we realize. I have found that everytime
that I walk around my neighborhood and really look around. I have seen things that I
never noticed before. Some of these are things that I've seen many times but just took
them for granted. For instance, I have many a tree in our neighborhood but I haven't
really looked at them. When you really look at the trees around you. You start to see
how amazing these plants are. They endur all kinds of hardship and still thrive. The
way that they hold the weigh of the world has always fascinated me.

These experience reminded me of my younger years when I would wonder around the neighborhood
looking at everything and anything. From the ground all the way to the clouds in the sky. I have
come to miss those times where we look at everything with wonder. I truly wish that more of
our younger generation learns to enjoy these wonders.
