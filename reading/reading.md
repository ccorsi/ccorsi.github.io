This page contains a list of books that I am currently reading.  While this list is fairly small since there is only
so many books that one can read concurrently.  It nonetheless contains a subset of the books that I am currently
reading.  There are others that I am reading but that I'm not necessarily going to complete.  This can be anything
from the fact that they aren't as interesting as I had anticipated or just that my interest has changed.  Granted,
more often than not the later is the main reason why I don't finish reading books.  This has more to do with the fact
that my interests are greater than I can manage.

As one looks through these list of books that I have completed.  There are many different subjects that interest me
that others might find interesting.  I don't profess to be a good reviewer nor is it my intention to become one.  These
lists are here more to remind me of the books that I have completed.  Since, there have been times that I start to read
a book only to end up realizing that I have already read that book!

Getting back to my point that thou this list is only for me. If others find something here that they enjoyed then I am
glad that I have pointed to something that you enjoyed.  Thus, I do hope that any one of the books that you do intend to
read, that, you will enjoy them as much as I did.
