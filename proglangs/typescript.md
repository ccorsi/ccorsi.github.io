The TypeScript programming language was created by Microsoft.  While JavaScript is a dynamically
typed programming language.  TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language.  One of the
advantage of this is that it will determine if your source is following the required contract of
your defined classes and functions during the compilation process.  This is something that
JavaScript doesn't provide since it isn't compiled prior to being used.  Thus, any issues with
your JavaScript implementation will only be *noticed* during the execution of the JavaScript
code itself.  Even then, it is possible that your tests will not cover all possible cases and
cause issues when your code is executed within a production environment.
