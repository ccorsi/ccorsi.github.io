This project was started when I was working for FuseSource before is was sold to RedHat.  FuseSource
was the company that was supporting the commercially supported products for ActiveMQ, Camel and ServiceMIX.
As part of those products, the company also produced products that were not part of the Apache Foundation
that extended the products mentioned above.  As part of my learning process for them.  I decided to create
several projects that would help me better understand those different projects.

This is one of those projects that was specifically created to learn how to use the ActiveMQ service broker.
The broker is the service that ActiveMQ clients connect to for sending and receive JMS messages.  These
messages can be Top or Queue type messages.  This project then provides one with the ability to start an
ActiveMQ broker.
