The template data loader project was something that just started to become its own project when using GoogleTests to
implement the different programming challenges that are part of the Techie Delight &lt;/&gt; web site.   The different
type of input that was required by those tests left me wondering if there was a way to add a test by only updating an
input file.  This then led me to create the dataloader project.
