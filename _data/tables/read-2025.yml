Why do we not understand how lucky we are living within a developed country.  With all of its conveniences and benefits compared to under developed countries that don't have what we have.  This book talks about this with respect to TB.  It lets us know that we can eradicate this disease if we choose to.  Lastly, it talks about how there are groups that are trying to do just that.  It is trying to instill a desire to join the cause against TB." } },
