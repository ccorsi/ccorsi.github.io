Yes, more died that got the vacine compared to those that didn't.  If you compare the percentage of people who died who got the vacine compared to those that didn't.  You would see that a greater percentage of people died who didn't get the vacine compared to those that did.  This was just one example where we see how easy it is to misinterpret the data.  The author does talk about how much certainty one has with certain set of data compared to others.  The more uncertainty there is the greater the range of estimates because of being unable to properly quantify the information.

What is worse is that we've offered solutions that we known don't work to the poor people around the world.  These solutions end up making their lives worse instead of better.  On top of that, they require some unreasonable requirements like having to travel long distances to be able to be administered the drugs to fight the disease.
